# Image Classification using TensorFlow

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify celestial objects such as constellations, galaxies, nebulae, planets, and stars. Leveraging TensorFlow, the model achieves a classification accuracy of 90%, making it a reliable tool for space object identification.

## Project Overview
Space exploration inspires curiosity and innovation. This project contributes by classifying different celestial objects based on their images. The model is designed to assist astronomers, researchers, and space enthusiasts in identifying cosmic entities with precision.




## Features

- Dataset: Contains labeled images of various celestial objects.
- Model: TensorFlow-based neural network for image classification.
- Accuracy: Achieved a robust 90% accuracy.
- Applications: Useful in astronomy, education, and scientific research.



## ðŸ›  Tools and Technology
- Python: Core programming language.
